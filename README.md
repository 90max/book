This is now the third time we have run a coding course at Collective, but this one is different.

Firstly, the quality of applications has been uniformly high and we have had to turn away some very good applicants. If you are on this course, it is because we think you are capable of getting a lot from it and of giving a lot back in return. 

Secondly, for the first two courses we relied heavily on Udacity's Python-based [CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101) and [CS253](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) for our syllabus. These are great courses--and we recommend them--but this is a course primarily about web development and for that the language of choice is JavaScript.

Thirdly, midway through the second course we started to experiment with working in groups and we liked the results. So, this time  we are going to organise ourselves into groups right from the start.
