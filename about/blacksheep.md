# Black Sheep

Access to the Academy classroom is through the coffee shop and down the spiral staircase (please do make sure you introduce yourself to Ben behind the counter as you go through).

[Black Sheep](http://www.leavetheherdbehind.com/) are Collective members, lovely people--and they make the best coffee in London.

They are in the final hours of their [kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832525384/black-sheep-coffee) to help fund the conversion of No. 26 into the best coffee shop in London and they are offering us a fantastic deal to help them meet their target.

You have two options:

* £50 for "all you can drink" coffees and teas Monday-Friday for 8 weeks
* £190 for "all you can drink + 40 gourmet toasts (lunch every day) + 40 basic toasts (breakfast)  Monday-Friday for 8 weeks  

Please go now to their [[kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832525384/black-sheep-coffee) and pledge either amount and ask for "no reward".
