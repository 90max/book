# Black Sheep

Access to the Academy classroom is through the coffee shop and down the spiral staircase.

[Black Sheep](http://www.leavetheherdbehind.com/) are Collective members and they make the best coffee in London.

Please make sure you introduce yourself to Ben behind the counter.

We have negotiated an off-peak student discount, so please try to use them mid-morning or after the lunchtime rush or whenever Ben is not rushed off his feet.
