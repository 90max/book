# Collective

We are part of [Collective](http://camdencollective.co.uk/).

Collective's remit is to support creative people into employment and in setting up their own businesses and the Academy is part of that remit.

Collective is funded by the Mayor of Londonâ€™s Regeneration Fund, Camden Council and [Camden Town Unlimited](http://www.camdentownunlimited.com/), the Business Improvement District for Camden Town whose office is just across the road.
