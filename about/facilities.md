# Facilities

This is a shared space. Jerome and Anneke are in the front, planning the launch of the first range of watches from the Camden Watch Company. Upstairs is a rotating exhibition space. Please respect the other users of the building.

You are welcome to use the kitchen area (we are still waiting for a microwave and fridge).

I apologise in advance for the state of the toilets.

You are welcome to enjoy the garden and use it for working in.

We do not have a cleaner at 26. Please clean up after yourself.
