**Workload**  
This is a very demanding full-time course that covers a lot of material in a very short space of time and requires a very high level of commitment. It is not suitable for someone who has any other significant commitments.

**Timetable**  
Classes start at 10am and end at 6pm Monday to Friday.

**Equipment**  
You will need to bring your own laptop computer. If you do not have a laptop, we may be able to provide you with one, but you need to let us know in advance.

**Etiquette**  
Treat everyone on the course and other users of the space with kindness and respect. Do not make remarks that are likely to be offensive to others. No subtle sexism (or any "isms", for that matter). Do not put other people down. Do not attempt to justify yourself when your behaviour is challenged, just apologise and move on. 

**Health**  
When working at a computer, it is very easy to forget to look after yourself. Remember to take a short break every 20 minutes or so. Lean back in your chair. Place the palm of your hands on your eyes or slowly turn your head around and focus your eyes in the middle distance or out of the window for 20 seconds. At least every hour, go for a walk and stretch your legs.
