# Product owner

## Responsibilities

* Present your group's work at the daily code review;
* Act as the *Product Owner* (see [Agile software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development));
* In *PivotalTracker*, *Accept* or *Reject* delivered stories;
* Ensure that you understand each *accepted* story;

###First rule of presenting

Do not use the word *"I"* in a presentation where *"we"* would work just as well. You are presenting the group's work, not your own.
