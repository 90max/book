Roles

As well as working on different parts of the project together, there will be four specific roles within each group:

* Journalist, who will create a daily record of the groupâ€™s work on their group blog;
* Project manager, who will run the morning scrum;
* Tutor, who will prepare a daily five-minute tutorial;
* Presenter, who will prepare a daily five-minute presentation of working code.  

Decide in your groups who is going to take which role and stick with that role for the length of the project.

The roles will be rotated each week.
