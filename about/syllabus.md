# Provisional syllabus

Don't take this syllabus too seriously. It is likely to change.

### Week 1 development environments, source control, agile development and building static websites

PivotalTracker, Git, GitHub, GitHub pages, Jekyll, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass. Setting up on OS X, Windows or Unix.

Prerequisites:

* [Stanford's Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101) CS101 is a gentle introduction to programming concepts that uses (a slightly doctored version of) JavaScript, so it is perfect for our purposes. Expect to spend about 10-15 hours on it, including watching the lectures and completing the exercises.

* [Codecademy's HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) Learn the building blocks of web development with HTML and CSS, and create your own website by the end of the course. 7 hours.

* [Codecademy's jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery) jQuery uses JavaScript to easily build interactive websites. Learn animation, events and DOM manipulation. 3 hours.

* [Codecademy's JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) Learn how to make your websites interactive and how to build browser based games. 10 hours.

* [**CSS Diner**](http://flukeout.github.io/#), a great way to learn CSS selectors. Hint: the answers to the first three levels are *"plate"*, *"bento"* and *"#fancy"*, respectively. Hopefully, you will be able to take it from there.

### Reading (and watching) list

[**Crockford on JavaScript**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB). A wonderful series of lectures by Doug Crockford. A panaramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. Make a note of any terms you do not understand (of which there will be several) and we can return to them over the course of the next two months. Watch each lecture until you are no longer enjoying the experience and then fast forward or move onto the next one (Lecture 3 is probably the hardest to follow), but don't give up until the last of the eight lectures. You may want to rewatch these lectures at the end of the course. Up to 10 hours of viewing pleasure.

[**Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant**](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX). *"Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right...But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups"*.

[**Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future**](http://youtu.be/5Tk09c0FQ3M), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[**The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental**](http://youtu.be/gTAghAJcO1o), a talk by Alan Kay.

[**Inventing on Principle**](http://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.
