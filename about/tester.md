# Tester

The tester's role is technically challenging, particularly in the first week. 

The tester's main responsiblitity is to turn *user stories* in *Trello* into acceptance tests using *Mocha* and *Supertest*. Do not attempt to do this alone, but pair up with one of the other tester's. See the notes on *BDD* in Week 1.
