# Week 1 homework

##Finish off pre-course assignments

Make sure that you finish the [pre-course assignments](assignments/pre) and also return to the optional assignments, as and when you have time.

##Git and GitHub

Continue to get more familiar with Git. 

Start with [Git for the lazy](http://wiki.spheredev.org/Git_for_the_lazy) and [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

Take a look at these videos: [Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/videos) and [GitHub & Git Foundations](http://vimeo.com/album/2763106/video/88271920). 

And try out these online tutorials: [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) and [learnGitBranching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/). They both cover similar ground. Try them both out. See which one you find most useful.

##Chrome DevTools

Start work on the [Discover DevTools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) course at Code School. The DevTools are going to be be essential from Week 2 onwards.
