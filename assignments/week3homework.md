# Week 3 homework

##Node.js revision

Two options:

Either, read the [*The Node Beginner Book*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzAAKt4fbFbgdTg3TDlqT2J1eDg/edit?usp=sharing)ï»¿ and try working through the exercises.

Or, complete [*Level 1: Intro to Node.js*](http://node.codeschool.com/levels/1/) on Code School.

Even better: try them both and tell us which one you prefer.

##JavaScript Style Guide

Read the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
